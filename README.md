# Cluster-Software-Project
University software project C

In this project I implemented an algorithm for detecting community structures (or
clusters) in a network. The ability to detect such groups is of significant importance.
For example, partitioning a protein-protein interaction network into clusters can provide a
modular view of the network, with different groups of nodes performing different functions
within the cell.
